# This is a test!

This is an entirely new readme. I thought I would just replace the whole thing and start afresh. This project does three things: it prints fizzbuzz, lists the primes from 1 to 100, and prints 100 triangular numbers.
## So I though I'd make myself a smaller heading...

And it works! 
Here's another edit, just so I can get another commit out of this thing.
